# fraud_detection
This python program uses ml algorithms to flag a fradulent transaction.

To tackle this issue, the project uses two anomaly detection methods: 
•Isolation Forest (IF) 
•Local Outlier Factor (LOF) 

The workflow consists of :
•Data preprocessing
•Feature scaling
•Training the anomaly detection models
•Evaluating performance with confusion matrices and classification reports
